// Write a function that calculates how long it takes a student to get to university. 
// The function takes three numbers:
// •	The first is the number of steps the student takes from their home to the university
// •	Тhe second number is the length of the student's footprint in meters
// •	Тhe third number is the student speed in km/h
// Every 500 meters the student rests and takes a 1 minute break.
// Calculate how long the student walks from home to university and print on the console the result in the following format: 
// 'hours:minutes:seconds'.
// The input comes as three numbers.
// The output should be printed on the console.

function walk(steps,lenght,speed){
let distance = steps*lenght;

let speedPerSec = speed/3.6;
let time = (distance/speedPerSec);
let minutesToBrake = Math.floor(distance/500);

let minutes = Math.floor(time/60);
let sec = Math.round(time-(minutes*60));
let hours = Math.floor(time/3600);

return ((hours < 10 ? "0" : "") + hours + ":" + (minutes + minutesToBrake< 10 ? "0" : "") + (minutes+minutesToBrake) + ":" + (sec < 10 ? "0" : "") + sec);

}
